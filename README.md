# Prediction on Daily Stock Data Using Deep Neural Network

## Overview
This project's main goal is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based stock price prediction model. I have sought to evaluate the model's capability to reliably predict the future prices of selected firm stocks through the acquisition of precise historical data, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
